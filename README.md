Login UI for a Flutter App

This project is a simple login UI for a Flutter app. It uses the following widgets:

TextField
Button
Image
Checkbox
Icon
The app bar has the title "Login". The TextFields are used for the username and password. The button is used to submit the login credentials. The image is the Flutter logo.

The login credentials are validated using the following steps:

The username is checked to see if it is a valid email address.
The password is checked to see if it is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.
If the login credentials are valid, the user is taken to the home screen of the app. If the login credentials are invalid, an error message is displayed.

This project is a good starting point for building more complex login UIs in Flutter. It demonstrates the use of basic widgets and the validation of login credentials.

Here are some additional things you could mention in your project description:

The design of the login UI, including the colors, fonts, and spacing.
The functionality of the login UI, such as how the username and password are validated and how the user is taken to the home screen if the login is successful.
The challenges you faced in building the login UI and how you overcame them.
Any future improvements you would like to make to the login UI.
